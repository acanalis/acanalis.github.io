<p>This blog will be devoted to my learning experiences in programming. In fact, building this site is an experience in Hugo, the World&rsquo;s Fastest Static Site Generatorâ„¢. There are many themes that you can choose from, but trying to dissect them is not the best learning experience. So I started everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Welcome and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
